        <h1>Mandala</h1>
        <p>
        The monks bend over the floor and rub styluses against their sticks of colored chalk.
        Scratch, scratch, scratch.<br> Slowly, the wheel forms, and together they create intricate symmetrical whorls and loops and bends and curves.<br> The monks hum and chant as they build the patterns.<br>
            Not once do they speak.
            Only through their prayers do they keep the flow.
        They change direction all at once, like a flock of birds shifting in the wind.
            Coming closer at the center,
            scratching circles of shifting color.
            And then, they finish. The master nods, takes out a broom, and sweeps the chalk away.</p>
